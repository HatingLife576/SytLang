          Hi. HTML is stupid, so we are designing a better version. Welcome to SytLang (Pronounced Site-Lang), SytLang is a wonderful new idea, bringing a new future of web design. We currently cannot work on the project because of one reason: money. We want to build SytLang and make it a reality. SiteLang was designed by a front-end dveloper (that does some back-end but is still learning stuff), Safyre Lyons. She made it after getting frustraited with HTML and how dumb it looks and how unintuitive it is. She finds it dumb that she has to write the whole tag with the stupid arrow tags that WONT WORK typing them into another tag before creating a tag. She also does not like how to end tags. She believes firmly that { } are the way to go. After a few hours of design, here is the code:

          It is so far incomplete and it will take time and a community to make it better! If you want to make this into a language, by all means take it, distribute it, share it, make it. We are making this open-source to everyone! Anyone can edit, create, make this project. Only rules: you have to have it be open-source, must have it to be an interpreter to HTML (for reasons of making sure people can use it). That's it! No need pay us, no need to mention us! SytLang is just my creation to make something new.
