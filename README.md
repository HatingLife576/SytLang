## What is SytLang?
SytLang is a language that interprets the code you write to HTML. It makes it easier to code the entire thing.

## Why SytLang?
Just another option to use. 

## Why so long before actual development?
I want to finsih other projects I have been needing to do (An operating system, a website builder, college) and I need to focus on one thing at a time. The website builder is a future project. I also want to start working on more front-end stuff (I am better with front-end than back-end) and I also want to learn more languages.
